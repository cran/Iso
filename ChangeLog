# Information about the changes 0.0-4 |--> 0.0-5 |--> 0.0-6
# will be added ``when I get around to it''. :-)

# 24/August/2009

Version 0.0-6 |--> 0.0-7:

(1) Added namespace; changed name of .First.lib()
    in First.R to .onLoad().  (As one must when adding
    a namespace, apparently.)

    Thanks to Tobias Verbeke for instigating this change
    and for showing me how to do it.

(2) Removed announcement of old changes from .First.lib();
    put in announcement of addition of namespace.

# 23/October/2009

Version 0.0-7 |--> 0.0-8:

(1) Added bivariate isotonic capabilities, using Applied
    Statistics Algorithm AS 206, at the request of
    Paramjit Gill.

(2) Corrected the spelling of ``NAMESPACE'' (!!!) in a
    message produced by the .onLoad() function.

# 5/September/2011

Version 0.0-8: |--> 0.0-9:

(1) Changed some titles in the help files to avoid cock-ups
    in the INDEX file (since R CMD INSTALL now seems to truncate
    titles that are over 72 characters long.

Version 0.0.9 |--> 0.0-10

(1) Got rid of the INDEX file completely!  Seems not to be needed,
    and just causes trouble.

(2) Got rid of the "now has a NAMESPACE" message in First.R, since
    *everything* now has a namespace!
