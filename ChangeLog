Version 0.0-6 |--> 0.0-7:

(1) Added namespace; changed name of .First.lib()
    in First.R to .onLoad().  (As one must when adding
    a namespace, apparently.)

    Thanks to Tobias Verbeke for instigating this change
    and for showing me how to do it.

(2) Removed announcement of old changes from .First.lib();
    put in announcement of addition of namespace.

Version 0.0-7 |--> 0.0-8:

(1) Added bivariate isotonic capabilities, using Applied
    Statistics Algorithm AS 206, at the request of
    Paramjit Gill.

(2) Corrected the spelling of ``NAMESPACE'' (!!!) in a
    message produced by the .onLoad() function.
