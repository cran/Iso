# Information about the changes 0.0-4 |--> 0.0-5 |--> 0.0-6
# will be added ``when I get around to it''. :-)

# 24/August/2009

Version 0.0-6 |--> 0.0-7:

(1) Added namespace; changed name of .First.lib()
    in First.R to .onLoad().  (As one must when adding
    a namespace, apparently.)

    Thanks to Tobias Verbeke for instigating this change
    and for showing me how to do it.

(2) Removed announcement of old changes from .First.lib();
    put in announcement of addition of namespace.

# 23/October/2009

Version 0.0-7 |--> 0.0-8:

(1) Added bivariate isotonic capabilities, using Applied
    Statistics Algorithm AS 206, at the request of
    Paramjit Gill.

(2) Corrected the spelling of ``NAMESPACE'' (!!!) in a
    message produced by the .onLoad() function.

# 5/September/2011

Version 0.0-8: |--> 0.0-9:

(1) Changed some titles in the help files to avoid cock-ups
    in the INDEX file (since R CMD INSTALL now seems to truncate
    titles that are over 72 characters long.

Version 0.0.9 |--> 0.0-10

(1) Got rid of the INDEX file completely!  Seems not to be needed,
    and just causes trouble.

(2) Got rid of the "now has a NAMESPACE" message in First.R, since
    *everything* now has a namespace!

# 11/January/2013

Version 0.0-10 |--> 0.0-11

(1) Fixed a bug in the Fortran code for the "smooth" algorithm
    underlying the biviso() function.  In this code some dimensions
    were hard-wired at 20. This caused the function to throw an error
    if the matrix of values being isotonized was bigger than 20 x 20.
    I revised the code so that the dimensions are now dynamic.

    Thanks go to Jing Qin by whom this bug was drawn to my attention.

(2) While doing some checking I noticed that the function was
    returning results that weren't *quite* isotonic.  Made
    adjustments to value of "eps" and made "EPS" an argument of
    the "PAV" subroutine.  This appeared to reduce the problem
    substantially but did not quite eliminate it completely.

(3) It also made the algorithm sometimes fail to converge, so
    I incremented the default value of "ncycle" from 1000 to
    10000, which seems to fix the problem.

# 11/January/2013

(1) Changed the function in First.R from .onLoad() to
.onAttach() to satisfy CRAN bureaucracy.
